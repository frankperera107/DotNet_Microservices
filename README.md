This project is based on the .NET Microservices course taught by Les Jackson, which I followed and implemented. The main features of this project include:

Two .NET Microservices.
RabbitMQ as a message bus for asynchronous communication between the services.
SQL Server as the primary database, with an in-memory database option.
All services are hosted in Docker containers.
Services are orchestrated using Kubernetes.
Nginx is used as the API Gateway."
